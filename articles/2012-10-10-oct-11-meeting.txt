Bring your projects and hang out with us this Thursday. We'll have wraps and fruit available for dinner; you're also welcome to bring something and use the microwave or toaster oven. We're looking for sponsors for future dinners. Our group is a collection of self-motivated learners engaged in continual self-improvement. Would your employer like to put its name in front of such a group?

See ya tomorrow!
