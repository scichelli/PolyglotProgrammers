Because our host <a href="http://www.headspring.com/">Headspring</a> is moving into a new office this weekend, Polyglot Programmers will be moving right along with them. Starting with the first meeting in July, meetings will be in the new location.

The new address is 10415 Morado Circle, Building 3, Third Floor, Austin, TX 78759.
