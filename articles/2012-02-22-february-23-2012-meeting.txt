title: "Feb 23 Meeting, with Haskell"

Fourth Thursday, time for our second meeting. Fifteen developers joined us last time, and the spirit was effervescent with possibility and collaboration.

We'll follow the same format tomorrow: Arrive at 6 pm, find a spot, work alone or with buddies on a project of your own choosing. Feel free to bring your own dinner; we have microwaves available.

At 7:30 we'll take a break and hear a 20-minute presentation from one of our peers; in this case, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/lonestardev">Louis Salin</a> will tell us a story about Haskell. True to the Polyglot spirit, Louis is learning in public, putting his <a href="https://github.com/louissalin/haskell-exercises">Haskell exercises on GitHub</a>. 

After that, we'll continue hacking away, wrapping up at 9.

If you want to share what you're learning during the break in a future meeting, catch Sharon in person or tweet at @PolyglotATX.

Hope to see you tomorrow!
